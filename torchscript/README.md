# Adding MDLA to pytorch backend using Torchscript

This folder contains example implementation of mdla backend for pytorch.

The content here follows the [PyTorch JIT compiler tutorial](https://jott.live/markdown/Writing%20a%20Toy%20Backend%20Compiler%20for%20PyTorch).
and the [torch tvm example](https://github.com/pytorch/tvm)

 - [intro torchscript](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html)
 - [overview](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/)

## Install

Download pybind11 from [here](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/tree/97784dad3e518ccb415d5db57ff9b933495d9024) and put pybind11 folder in this folder.

Install pytorch from [source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)

Use the release tag v1.4.0

Build and install it using develop option as mentioned [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

```
python3 setup.py develop --prefix=~/.local
```
You will need libmicrondla installed

## Build and Test

Add `api.h`, `thvector.h` and `thnets.h` into `src` folder

Create a build folder and build torchMDLA using `build.sh`

```
mkdir build
./build.sh
```

`test.py` contains a simple test that run a convolution using torchMDLA

## Code details

The idea is to do:
1. a pytorch model is created in .py
2. torchscript will trace/script this model. Trace/script is run the model and creates a operations graph
3. add a pass to label parts of this graph as custom operation to be run differently
4. define how to run this new labeled subgraph

The source code is in source folder.

```
src
├── compiler.cpp
├── compiler.h
├── fusion_pass.cpp
├── fusion_pass.h
└── register.cpp
```

`register.cpp` does the main parts: register custom pass, register custom operation and create python module.

`fusion_pass.h` and `fusion_pass.cpp` have the implementation of the custom pass that will group supported operations together
into a subgraph or a custom operation. Operations are identified with a Symbol (interned string), such as: `aten::conv2d`.
The Symbol we gave to our custom operation is `mdla::CompilationGroup`.

When `torch.jit.trace` or `graph_for` are called in python, this pass will be called and then it will run through the entire graph.

`compiler.h` and `compiler.cpp` have the implementation of the custom operation. It has a run function that will be called
whenever the custom operation is saw in the graph. The run function gets a subgraph that contains the operations (Nodes)
in the custom operation `mdla::CompilationGroup`. Run function also gets the input tensors through a Stack.
Output of the subgraph is updated throught this Stack.

In the run function, compile and runtime for `mdla::CompilationGroup` is implemented using microndla api functions.

pybind11 folder is [pybind code](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) used to create python module with C++ code.
